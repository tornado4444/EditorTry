# MY OPENGL ENGINE!
Here been my project OpenGL! It's don't my first project, it's just my repeat about OpenGL, and I'm tried to create(how is possibly) greate the engine on OpenGL! The repository is been update every day, why i don't finish this project! Lets start!

## 20.02.25
There is just simple check my triangle! And I'm decided make the font rendering(Signed distance field font rendering), and to be honest, I wanted to do this for a very long time, but I didn’t have enough experience to implement it, so I decided to do it now (for those who don’t know, I will describe everything in detail so that everyone understands exactly what I want to achieve).
### Result.
